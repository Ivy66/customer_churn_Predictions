<h1>Predicting Customer Churn in a subscription Business</h1>

This project contains a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn out of a subscription based business. This model is built in python and also utilizes various data science techniques such as data cleaning, explotaroy data analysis and machine learning 

**DataSet**

The data set used in this project is the "Customer Churn Prediction" dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains information about customers of a telecommunication company, including demographic information, usage pattern, and whether or not they churned. 
The datasetcan be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

**Data Cleaning** 

The first step in building tjis predictive model was to clean the dataset. This involved removing missing values, removing unnecessary columns etc.

**Explatory Data Analysis**

After cleaning the dataset, i performed explatory data analysis (EDA)) to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the variables and the dataset. I used various visualization techniques such as pie charts and  Histograms to explore the dataset

**Modelling**

I built several machine learning models to predict customer churn, including support vector machines, random forest, and logistic regression. i used cross- validation techniques to evaluate the performance of each model based on its accuracy and other metrics 

**Visualization**
I created visualizations to help communicate the results of the analysis and to help in the interpreting the performance of the predictive mode. I used various python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seborn to create visualization.

**Conclusion**

I built a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn out of a subscription business. This model achieved high accuracy and was. able to identify important features that contribute to cuustomer churn. This information can be used by businesses to develop strategies to reduce customer churn and increse customer retention
